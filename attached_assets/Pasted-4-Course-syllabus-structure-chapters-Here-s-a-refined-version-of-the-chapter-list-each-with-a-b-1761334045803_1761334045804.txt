4. Course syllabus (structure/chapters)

Here’s a refined version of the chapter list, each with a brief-bulleted description:

Swara Variations Exercise (Sa Re Ga Ma Pa)
Explore the five swara sequence in every permutation, keeping tonic and fifth fixed. You will transpose the pattern, vary intervallic motion, and add a bass-line thematic left-hand.

Mixolydian Improv Exercise
Use the IV → I → VII♭ chord progression from Mixolydian. Improvise in Mixolydian, Major-Blues and Minor-Blues scales. We include theory for scale-building, inversions and plagal cadences.

“Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” – Left Hand Bass (Harmony)
Support the familiar melody with a root-and-fifth bass in the left hand. Learn how stacking root/fifth thickens melody accompaniment.

“Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” – Left Hand Arpeggios (Harmony)
Use classical left-hand arpeggio patterns with tonic, predominant and dominant chords to harmonise the melody.

“Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” – Melodic Chord Inversions (Harmony)
Use chord inversions so the melody note always rings at the top. Right hand handles chord voicings; left hand handles bass.

“Oom-Pah!” Rhythm Pattern – Piano Left Hand
Master the “oom-pah” left-hand groove (I, IV, V major/minor). Play this while your right hand handles an agile melody.

Highest Note Inversion Exercise
Train the concept of “highest note as melody” in chord inversions. Explore major & minor scales with inverted support chords and melodic phrasing.

Pendulum Exercise – Eighth-Note Patterns
Use major and harmonic minor scales around tonic to create swinging eighth-note patterns. Focus on finger crossing (thumb) and scale fluency.

Spider Exercise – Finger Independence & Scale Mastery
The “Spider” uses 5-note cycles with a chromatic variant in the middle. Practice on multiple keys. Left hand supplies bass movement. Builds strength, independence and control.

Exploring & Practising Thirds on the Piano
Using major and harmonic minor scales, form diatonic thirds (major/minor). Study patterns built on close- and spread-thirds.

Basic Finger Independence Piano Exercise
Using the first five notes (Sa Re Ga Ma Pa) in major & minor, work finger-by-finger in right hand while left hand provides bass support.

Accented Arpeggios
Discover irregular quaver groupings (“accents”) applied over chord progressions. Begin with simple patterns, move into accented phrases. Includes reference to “Clocks” by Coldplay.

Sixteenth Arpeggio Accents
In semiquavers, practice varied accent-groupings that strengthen timing and independence. We’ll arrange a section inspired by “Summer of ’69” by Bryan Adams.

Accents in Both Hands + Pulse
Use a 3-3-2 beat-grouping accent scheme. Right-hand arpeggio, left-hand toggles between pulse, accents and slow-pulse. Learn to keep RH steady while LH plays accents over bass line. Includes melody applications (e.g., “Ode to Joy”).

Salsa Piano 1 – Tresillo
Learn the iconic Tresillo pattern (Afro-Cuban) via body percussion and bongos.

Right hand: chord hits & pulse

Left hand: bass line + chord pulses

Then bass line + melody in RH

Salsa Piano 2 – Claves
Explore Son 3:2 & 2:3 Clave, Rumba Clave & Bossa Clave. Use body percussion, bongos and theory behind the rhythm on piano.

Building Rhythmic Phrases using Konnakol
Using the South-Indian vocal percussion system of Konnakol, build rhythmic phrases combining beat-division, melody and chords.

Blues with Left Hand Bass Patterns
Explore the 12-bar blues form, build dominant-7th chords plus the Charleston rhythm. Develop idiomatic left-hand bass patterns and work on singing/play-along with your left-hand performance.

Pivot Thirds – Major Formation (Part 1)
Use floating thirds over anchor notes (root & fifth) in major scale context. Practice with triplet rhythms.

Pivot Thirds – Minor Scale with Rhythmic Variations (Part 2)
Continue with minor-scale contexts: harmonic, natural, Dorian & melodic minor. Explore rhythmic challenges: triplets, semiquavers, 3-3-2 accent, 3-3-3-3-4 accents, odd metres (7/8, 5/8).

Major Chord Shapes using the Circle of Fifths
Apply the geometry of the Circle of Fifths to form all twelve major chords using neighbour relationships and similar piano shapes.

Minor Chord Shapes using the Circle of Fifths
Using the same geometry, form all twelve minor chords and identify common “misnomers” or pitfalls.

The Mother of ALL Chord Progressions (I Will Survive)
Using the diatonic circle of fifths, explore a long chord chain built on fifth-interval motion. Cover major and minor tonalities. Arrangement includes I Will Survive (80s hit by Gloria Gaynor) to apply theory in context.

Diatonic Seventh Chords on Piano
Build seventh chords within the major scale. Understand how to build and play them, and recognise their qualities.

Formation of ALL Seventh Chords on Piano
Expand to all seventh-chord families (major, minor, diminished, augmented, suspended) from a single root. Also touch briefly on “janya ragas” (for cross-genre flavour).

Diatonic Seventh Chord Practice (Up & Down)
Using the C-major scale, practise ascending & descending patterns with seventh chords. Introduce the rhythm pattern used in the next lesson (“La La Land”).

ii-V-I Rhythm Patterns (Block, Latin & La La Land Arpeggio)
Work on the classic jazz progression ii–V–I in major scale. Explore three rhythm-approaches:

Block chords + Charleston in LH

Latin rhythm pattern + slow LH pulse

“La La Land” arpeggio approach
