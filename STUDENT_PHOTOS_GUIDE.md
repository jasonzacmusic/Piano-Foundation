# Student Photos Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Completed

I've updated your website to use the 2 photos you specified:
- **Hero Background**: `060A0073.jpg` (your classroom/teaching photo)
- **Instructor Photo**: `jason-riffs.jpg` (Jason Zac portrait)

I've also:
- Removed all placeholder images from `client/public/images/`
- Kept only the NSM logos (nsm-logo-main.png, nsm-logo-white.png, nsm-logo-black.png)
- Updated the vintage/rustic brown color scheme throughout the site
- Prepared space for 6 student testimonial photos

## üì∏ Next Steps: Adding Your Student Photos

Your testimonials section is ready for **6 student photos**. Here's how to add them:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Photos
- Take or select 6 photos of students playing piano
- Best practices:
  - High-quality images (at least 800x800 pixels)
  - Close-up or medium shots showing students engaged with the piano
  - Consistent lighting and style across all photos
  - Square (1:1) or portrait (4:5) aspect ratio works best

### Step 2: Rename Your Photos
Rename your 6 student photos to match these **exact filenames**:

1. `student-1.jpg` - Will appear with: "Aarushi" testimonial
2. `student-2.jpg` - Will appear with: "Geeth" testimonial  
3. `student-3.jpg` - Will appear with: "Priya Sharma" testimonial
4. `student-4.jpg` - Will appear with: "Ramesh Kumar" testimonial
5. `student-5.jpg` - Will appear with: "Meera Iyer" testimonial
6. `student-6.jpg` - Will appear with: "Arjun Desai" testimonial

### Step 3: Upload to the Images Folder
1. Navigate to: `client/public/images/` in the file browser
2. Drag and drop your 6 renamed student photos into this folder
3. **That's it!** The website will automatically display them - no code changes needed
