The faculty is very good. Jason is a very good teacher and has taught us in such a way that we understand theory well. It has given me the opportunity to mix with the youngsters which I enjoyed. I have finished my 2nd level in keyboard and am very much looking forward to level 3. I have also started to respect a song, the musician and the instruments. A big thank you once again."

I'd highly recommend Jason from beginners through to advanced players, you won't regret it."

I did the level 1 vocals, and a level 1 and level 2 in keyboard. The curriculum is very well designed. I loved the theory classes with Jason. Even theory was taught in a very practical manner. Jason's keyboard classes are also the BEST. He is an amazing teacher who makes learning music a joyride. I had never played keyboard before in my life but within 8 months time I could pick up quite a bit. Along with the learning, the experience of jamming with a band, performing at the concert and recording in a studio is something that I loved. Another good thing is they keep having several workshops for those who want to learn more. The school is a great place for anyone who is sincere about music. You will have to put in the hard work and the hours but you will learn a ton."

    },
    {
      "question": "Is this only for beginners?",
      "answer": "Not at all! While the Foundation Course is perfect for beginners, it's also designed for students from Trinity/ABRSM or self-taught musicians who want to build stronger rhythmic, harmonic, and real-world playing skills. Many intermediate players join to \"fill the gaps\" and strengthen their fundamentals."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I miss a class?",
      "answer": "Every live session is recorded in HD and shared privately with you. You'll also receive assignments and feedback through our system so you never fall behind. You can even review topics anytime using our dedicated Video Courses section on nathanielschool.com."

      "question": "What age group is this for?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Can I learn from outside India?",
      "answer": "Yes! Our classes are time-zone friendly and available live online or in hybrid mode (live + recordings). We have students joining from all over the world ‚Äî from Singapore to the U.S. ‚Äî learning at their convenience."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I get a certificate after completing the course?",
      "answer": "Yes. You'll receive a graded performance-based certificate from the Nathaniel School of Music after completing your semester. It reflects your progress in technique, theory, rhythm, and performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time should I practice every week?",
      "answer": "We recommend at least 30 minutes a day or 3‚Äì4 hours a week to see steady progress. Each class includes practical exercises, chord work, and rhythm drills that you can build upon at home."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I continue learning after the Foundation Course?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. You can move into our advanced Music Method modules where you'll learn performance repertoire, improvisation, and stage collaboration with other musicians."
    },
    {
      "question": "What styles of music will I learn?",
      "answer": "You'll explore Blues, Gospel, Pop, Rock, Bollywood, and Indian Ragas, so you can perform in multiple styles confidently. Each concept is linked to real songs and rhythm patterns for practical use."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I get to showcase my performance somewhere?",

These will give you a good idea of what our classes are like and the kind of learning experience you can expect."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the learning approach in the Piano Foundation Course?",
      "answer": "We start from the absolute fundamentals ‚Äî from understanding the piano keys to correct posture. From the very first class, students learn to play with both hands. Our lessons are not limited to one genre or key. Students explore a variety of musical styles and practice in different keys, helping them become versatile pianists. By the end of the course, every student is trained to perform both as a solo pianist and as an accompanist. We also encourage students to suggest songs they would like to learn, making the experience more personal and relevant."
