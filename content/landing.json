The faculty is very good. Jason is a very good teacher and has taught us in such a way that we understand theory well. It has given me the opportunity to mix with the youngsters which I enjoyed. I have finished my 2nd level in keyboard and am very much looking forward to level 3. I have also started to respect a song, the musician and the instruments. A big thank you once again."

Jason is an incredible teacher, he has a natural ability to teach complex methods but in a way that is easy to understand. As I live abroad, lessons are done online via Zoom and Jason checks in during the week in a private WhatsApp group to review homework, etc, as well as answering any questions I have. I'd highly recommend Jason from beginners through to advanced players, you won't regret it."

      "quote": "I started with Nathaniel's about a year back. The school was recommended by a friend of mine who had done a guitar course here and I'm so glad I took the decision to join it. I did the level 1 vocals, and a level 1 and level 2 in keyboard. The curriculum is very well designed. I loved the theory classes with Jason. Even theory was taught in a very practical manner. Jason's keyboard classes are also the BEST. He is an amazing teacher who makes learning music a joyride. I had never played keyboard before in my life but within 8 months time I could pick up quite a bit. Along with the learning, the experience of jamming with a band, performing at the concert and recording in a studio is something that I loved. Another good thing is they keep having several workshops for those who want to learn more. The school is a great place for anyone who is sincere about music. You will have to put in the hard work and the hours but you will learn a ton."
